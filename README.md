# PiFrame
The PiFrame is a mainframe MVS3.8J built on the raspberry Pi with a few extra bells and whistles to make it look oldy worldy. It's a fun project to get started on mainframes (or to have one of your own sitting on your desk). It runs on Raspberry Pi 4 or 5, uses cool-retro-term to mimic a CRT monitor and runs the fab MVS-TK5.
